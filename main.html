        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated and motivated programming student at The University of Western Ontario, with proficiency in Java, Python, C, C++, and Linux/Unix. In my most recent project, I developed a software program that reduced data processing time by 50% for a local business.
In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a deep love for sports, particularly basketball. Growing up in an athletic family, I quickly discovered my passion for the game and led my high school team to victory in the OFSAA Basketball tournament in 2019. This accomplishment required dedication, teamwork, and perseverance.
My experience in both programming and sports has taught me the importance of these qualities. I am always striving to improve and take on new challenges, and I am excited to bring this mindset to my future career in computer science.
If you are looking for a motivated and dedicated programming student with a passion for sports and design principles, I would be thrilled to connect with you.
